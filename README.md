# Base App with Marvel App example 

Welcome to the android app developed in **Kotlin**. This app uses as a base a previous development that forms the basis of it.
Its simple operation is described below:

## Functioning

Our app will take the data from the web 
>"https://gateway.marvel.com/".

This website allows us to register as a user and use the api for free up to 3000 calls per day.
To make use of the requests it is necessary with our registration in it to obtain the private and public keys, necessary for each request.

### Screens
The app shows a list of characters from the Marvel universe, which we can select to see their image a little larger and, if it has one, a brief description.
